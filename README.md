# hello-world
This is a wonderful start.
Life is not just about survival, but poetry and distance.
You are a girl, a girl I love,
Girl, I wish you happiness, have a boy who loves you.

You are a girl, a girl I love,
Girl, I wish you happiness, healthy and happy every day...
Bless you, Chinese girl, girl abroad, foreign girl
My girl, pay attention to safety, my mother is jealous of you,
You are the flower of the motherland, the flower of the bad guy.

Miss sister, girlfriend, female classmate, little girl
Every loved one I met and a stranger I didn’t meet,
I wish you a blessing and wish you good health every day.
Whether it’s a jealousy or a jealousy, or a big boy, an old boy
I am blessing you one by one, may you be healthy and happy every day! Family happiness

In fact, my biggest concern is the girl who loves, bless you.
I know you, girl who loves, pay attention to safety, my girl
I am also a girl, I wish myself happiness, healthy and happy every day.
My dearest mother once blessed me and my brother.
Girl, child, thank you, leaving my arm is still safe and healthy, know how to protect yourself

Isn't this supposed to thank you? I drop my mother!
On the contrary, we should be grateful for the hardships and love you have paid.
I want to give back all my love and blessings to you.
My mother, you are also a little girl, pay attention to protect yourself.
My mother, you are also a little girl, I also need my love.
My mother, you are also a little girl, a great mother.
